For example, the regular expression abc matches abc123, 123abc, and 123abcxyz. To require the match to occur only at the beginning or end, use an anchor.*MLF**MLF*Escaped characters: Most characters like abc123 can be used literally inside a regular expression. However, the characters \.*?+[{|()^$ must be preceded by a backslash to be seen as literal. For example, \. is a literal period and \\ is a literal backslash. Escaping can be avoided by using \Q...\E. For example: \QLiteral Text\E.*MLF**MLF*Case-sensitive: By default, regular expressions are case-sensitive. This can be changed via the "i" option. For example, the pattern i)abc searches for "abc" without regard to case. See below for other modifiers.*MLF**MLF*Options (case sensitive)*MLF* *MLF*At the very beginning of a regular expression, specify zero or more of the following options followed by a close-parenthesis. For example, the pattern "im)abc" would search for abc with the case-insensitive and multiline options (the parenthesis may be omitted when there are no options). Although this syntax breaks from tradition, it requires no special delimiters (such as forward-slash), and thus there is no need to escape such delimiters inside the pattern. In addition, performance is improved because the options are easier to parse.*MLF**MLF*iCase-insensitive matching, which treats the letters A through Z as identical to their lowercase counterparts.*MLF*m*MLF*Multiline. Views Haystack as a collection of individual lines (if it contains newlines) rather than as a single continuous line. Specifically, it changes the following:*MLF**MLF*1) Circumflex (^) matches immediately after all internal newlines -- as well as at the start of Haystack where it always matches (but it does not match after a newline at the very end of Haystack).*MLF**MLF*2) Dollar-sign ($) matches before any newlines in Haystack (as well as at the very end where it always matches).*MLF**MLF*For example, the pattern "m)^abc$" would not match the Haystack"xyz`r`nabc" unless the "m" option is present.*MLF**MLF*The "D" option is ignored when "m" is present.*MLF**MLF*sDotAll. This causes a period (.) to match all characters including newlines (normally, it does not match newlines). However, when the newline character is at its default of CRLF (`r`n), two dots are required to match it (not one). Regardless of this option, a negative class such as [^a] always matches newlines.*MLF*xIgnores whitespace characters in the pattern except when escaped or inside a character class. The characters `n and `t are among those ignored because by the time they get to PCRE, they are already raw/literal whitespace characters (by contrast, \n and \t are not ignored because they are PCRE escape sequences). The x option also ignores characters between a non-escaped # outside a character class and the next newline character, inclusive. This makes it possible to include comments inside complicated patterns. However, this applies only to data characters; whitespace may never appear within special character sequences such as (?(, which begins a conditional subpattern.*MLF*AForces the pattern to be anchored; that is, it can match only at the start of Haystack. Under most conditions, this is equivalent to explicitly anchoring the pattern by means such as "^".*MLF*DForces dollar-sign ($) to match at the very end of Haystack, even if Haystack's last item is a newline. Without this option, $ instead matches right before the final newline (if there is one). Note: This option is ignored when the "m" option is present.*MLF*JAllows duplicate named subpatterns. This can be useful for patterns in which only one of a collection of identically-named subpatterns can match. Note: If more than one instance of a particular name matches something, only the leftmost one is stored. Also, variable names are not case-sensitive.*MLF*UUngreedy. Makes the quantifiers *+?{} consume only those characters absolutely necessary to form a match, leaving the remaining ones available for the next part of the pattern. When the "U" option is not in effect, an individual quantifier can be made non-greedy by following it with a question mark. Conversely, when "U" is in effect, the question mark makes an individual quantifier greedy.*MLF*XPCRE_EXTRA. Enables PCRE features that are incompatible with Perl. Currently, the only such feature is that any backslash in a pattern that is followed by a letter that has no special meaning causes the match to fail and ErrorLevel to be set accordingly. This option helps reserve unused backslash sequences for future use. Without this option, a backslash followed by a letter with no special meaning is treated as a literal (e.g. \g and g are both recognized as a literal g). Regardless of this option, non-alphabetic backslash sequences that have no special meaning are always treated as literals (e.g. \/ and / are both recognized as forward-slash).*MLF*PPosition mode. This causes RegExMatch() to yield the position and length of the match and its subpatterns rather than their matching substrings. For details, see UnquotedOutputVar.*MLF*SStudies the pattern to try improve its performance. This is useful when a particular pattern (especially a complex one) will be executed many times. If PCRE finds a way to improve performance, that discovery is stored alongside the pattern in the cache for use by subsequent executions of the same pattern (subsequent uses of that pattern should also specify the S option because finding a match in the cache requires that the option letters exactly match, including their order).*MLF*CEnables the auto-callout mode. See Regular Expression Callouts for more info.*MLF*`nSwitches from the default newline character (`r`n) to a solitary linefeed (`n), which is the standard on UNIX systems. The chosen newline character affects the behavior of anchors (^ and $) and the dot/period pattern.*MLF*`rSwitches from the default newline character (`r`n) to a solitary carriage return (`r).*MLF*`aIn v1.0.46.06+, `a recognizes any type of newline, namely `r, `n, `r`n, `v/VT/vertical tab/chr(0xB), `f/FF/formfeed/chr(0xC), and NEL/next-line/chr(0x85). In v1.0.47.05+, newlines can be restricted to only CR, LF, and CRLF by instead specifying (*ANYCRLF) in uppercase at the beginning of the pattern (after the options); e.g. im)(*ANYCRLF)^abc$.*MLF**MLF*Note: Spaces and tabs may optionally be used to separate each option from the next.*MLF**MLF*Commonly Used Symbols and Syntax*MLF* *MLF*.By default, a dot matches any single character which is not part of a newline (`r`n) sequence, but this can be changed by using the DotAll (s), linefeed (`n), carriage return (`r), `a or (*ANYCRLF) options. For example, ab. matches abc and abz and ab_.*MLF***MLF*An asterisk matches zero or more of the preceding character, class, or subpattern. For example, a* matches ab and aaab. It also matches at the very beginning of any string that contains no "a" at all.*MLF**MLF*Wildcard: The dot-star pattern .* is one of the most permissive because it matches zero or more occurrences of any character (except newline: `r and `n). For example, abc.*123 matches abcAnything123 as well as abc123.*MLF**MLF*?A question mark matches zero or one of the preceding character, class, or subpattern. Think of this as "the preceding item is optional". For example, colou?r matches both color and colour because the "u" is optional.*MLF*+A plus sign matches one or more of the preceding character, class, or subpattern. For example a+ matches ab and aaab. But unlike a* and a?, the pattern a+ does not match at the beginning of strings that lack an "a" character.*MLF*{min,max}*MLF*Matches between min and max occurrences of the preceding character, class, or subpattern. For example, a{1,2} matches ab but only the first two a's in aaab.*MLF**MLF*Also, {3} means exactly 3 occurrences, and {3,} means 3 or more occurrences. Note: The specified numbers must be less than 65536, and the first must be less than or equal to the second.*MLF**MLF*[...]*MLF*Classes of characters: The square brackets enclose a list or range of characters (or both). For example, [abc] means "any single character that is either a, b or c". Using a dash in between creates a range; for example, [a-z] means "any single character that is between lowercase a and z (inclusive)". Lists and ranges may be combined; for example [a-zA-Z0-9_] means "any single character that is alphanumeric or underscore".*MLF**MLF*A character class may be followed by *, ?, +, or {min,max}. For example, [0-9]+ matches one or more occurrence of any digit; thus it matches xyz123 but not abcxyz.*MLF**MLF*The following POSIX named sets are also supported via the form [[:xxx:]], where xxx is one of the following words: alnum, alpha, ascii (0-127), blank (space or tab), cntrl (control character), digit (0-9), xdigit (hex digit), print, graph (print excluding space), punct, lower, upper, space (whitespace), word (same as \w).*MLF**MLF*Within a character class, characters do not need to be escaped except when they have special meaning inside a class; e.g. [\^a], [a\-b], [a\]], and [\\a].*MLF**MLF*[^...]Matches any single character that is not in the class. For example, [^/]* matches zero or more occurrences of any character that is not a forward-slash, such as http://. Similarly, [^0-9xyz] matches any single character that isn't a digit and isn't the letter x, y, or z.*MLF*\dMatches any single digit (equivalent to the class [0-9]). Conversely, capital \D means "any non-digit". This and the other two below can also be used inside a class; for example, [\d.-] means "any single digit, period, or minus sign".*MLF*\sMatches any single whitespace character, mainly space, tab, and newline (`r and `n). Conversely, capital \S means "any non-whitespace character".*MLF*\wMatches any single "word" character, namely alphanumeric or underscore. This is equivalent to [a-zA-Z0-9_]. Conversely, capital \W means "any non-word character".*MLF*^*MLF* $*MLF*Circumflex (^) and dollar sign ($) are called anchors because they don't consume any characters; instead, they tie the pattern to the beginning or end of the string being searched.*MLF**MLF*^ may appear at the beginning of a pattern to require the match to occur at the very beginning of a line. For example, ^abc matches abc123 but not 123abc.*MLF**MLF*$ may appear at the end of a pattern to require the match to occur at the very end of a line. For example, abc$ matches 123abc but not abc123.*MLF**MLF*The two anchors may be combined. For example, ^abc$ matches only abc (i.e. there must be no other characters before or after it).*MLF**MLF*If the text being searched contains multiple lines, the anchors can be made to apply to each line rather than the text as a whole by means of the "m" option. For example, m)^abc$ matches 123`r`nabc`r`n789. But without the "m" option, it wouldn't match.*MLF**MLF*\b\b means "word boundary", which is like an anchor because it doesn't consume any characters. It requires the current character's status as a word character (\w) to be the opposite of the previous character's. It is typically used to avoid accidentally matching a word that appears inside some other word. For example, \bcat\b doesn't match catfish, but it matches cat regardless of what punctuation and whitespace surrounds it. Capital \B is the opposite: it requires that the current character not be at a word boundary.*MLF*|The vertical bar separates two or more alternatives. A match occurs if any of the alternatives is satisfied. For example, gray|grey matches both gray and grey. Similarly, the pattern gr(a|e)y does the same thing with the help of the parentheses described below.*MLF*(...)*MLF*Items enclosed in parentheses are most commonly used to:*MLF*Determine the order of evaluation. For example, (Sun|Mon|Tues|Wednes|Thurs|Fri|Satur)day matches the name of any day.*MLF*Apply *, ?, +, or {min,max} to a series of characters rather than just one. For example, (abc)+ matches one or more occurrences of the string "abc"; thus it matches abcabc123 but not ab123 or bc123.*MLF*Capture a subpattern such as the dot-star in abc(.*)xyz. For example, RegExMatch() stores the substring that matches each subpattern in its output array. Similarly, RegExReplace() allows the substring that matches each subpattern to be reinserted into the result via backreferences like $1. To use the parentheses without the side-effect of capturing a subpattern, specify ?: as the first two characters inside the parentheses; for example: (?:.*)*MLF*Change options on-the-fly. For example, (?im) turns on the case-insensitive and multiline options for the remainder of the pattern (or subpattern if it occurs inside a subpattern). Conversely, (?-im) would turn them both off. All options are supported except DPS`r`n`a.*MLF**MLF*\t*MLF* \r*MLF* etc.*MLF*These escape sequences stand for special characters. The most common ones are \t (tab), \r (carriage return), and \n (linefeed). In AutoHotkey, an accent (`) may optionally be used in place of the backslash in these cases. Escape sequences in the form \xhh are also supported, in which hh is the hex code of any ANSI character between 00 and FF.*MLF**MLF*In v1.0.46.06+, \R means "any single newline of any type", namely those listed at the `a option (however, \R inside a character class is merely the letter "R"). In v1.0.47.05+, \R can be restricted to CR, LF, and CRLF by specifying (*BSR_ANYCRLF) in uppercase at the beginning of the pattern (after the options); e.g. im)(*BSR_ANYCRLF)abc\Rxyz*MLF**MLF*\p{xx}*MLF*\P{xx}*MLF*\X*MLF*[v1.0.90+]: Unicode character properties. Not supported on ANSI builds. \p{xx} matches a character with the xx property while \P{xx} matches any character without the xx property. For example, \pL matches any letter and \p{Lu} matches any upper-case letter. \X matches any number of characters that form an extended Unicode sequence.*MLF**MLF*For a full list of supported property names and other details, search for "\p{xx}" at www.pcre.org/pcre.txt.*MLF**MLF*(*UCP)*MLF*[v1.0.90+]: For performance, \d, \D, \s, \S, \w, \W, \b and \B recognize only ASCII characters by default, even on Unicode builds. If the pattern begins with (*UCP), Unicode properties will be used to determine which characters match. For example, \w becomes equivalent to [\p{L}\p{N}_] and \d becomes equivalent to \p{Nd}.*MLF**MLF**MLF*Greed: By default, *, ?, +, and {min,max} are greedy because they consume all characters up through the last possible one that still satisfies the entire pattern. To instead have them stop at the first possible character, follow them with a question mark. For example, the pattern <.+> (which lacks a question mark) means: "search for a <, followed by one or more of any character, followed by a >". To stop this pattern from matching the entire string <em>text</em>, append a question mark to the plus sign: <.+?>. This causes the match to stop at the first '>' and thus it matches only the first tag <em>.*MLF**MLF*Look-ahead and look-behind assertions: The groups (?=...), (?!...), (?<=...), and (?<!...) are called assertions because they demand a condition to be met but don't consume any characters. For example, abc(?=.*xyz) is a look-ahead assertion that requires the string xyz to exist somewhere to the right of the string abc (if it doesn't, the entire pattern is not considered a match). (?=...) is called a positive look-ahead because it requires that the specified pattern exist. Conversely, (?!...) is a negative look-ahead because it requires that the specified pattern not exist. Similarly, (?<=...) and (?<!...) are positive and negative look-behinds (respectively) because they look to the left of the current position rather than the right. Look-behinds are more limited than look-aheads because they do not support quantifiers of varying size such as *, ?, and +. The escape sequence \K is similar to a look-behind assertion because it causes any previously-matched characters to be omitted from the final matched string. For example, foo\Kbar matches "foobar" but reports that it has matched "bar".*MLF**MLF*Related: Regular expressions are supported by RegExMatch(), RegExReplace(), and SetTitleMatchMode.*MLF**MLF*Final note: Although this page touches upon most of the commonly-used RegEx features, there are quite a few other features you may want to explore such as conditional subpatterns.

The most common ones are \t (tab), \r (carriage return), and \n (linefeed). In AutoHotkey, an accent (`) may optionally be used in place of the backslash in these cases. Escape sequences in the form \xhh are also supported, in which hh is the hex code of any ANSI character between 00 and FF.*MLF**MLF*In v1.0.46.06+, \R means "any single newline of any type", namely those listed at the `a option (however, \R inside a character class is merely the letter "R"). In v1.0.47.05+, \R can be restricted to CR, LF, and CRLF by specifying (*BSR_ANYCRLF) in uppercase at the beginning of the pattern (after the options); e.g. im)(*BSR_ANYCRLF)abc\Rxyz*MLF**MLF*\p{xx}*MLF*\P{xx}*MLF*\X*MLF*[v1.0.90+]: Unicode character properties.

For example, \w becomes equivalent to [\p{L}\p{N}_] and \d becomes equivalent to \p{Nd}.*MLF**MLF**MLF*Greed: By default, *, ?, +, and {min,max} are greedy because they consume all characters up through the last possible one that still satisfies the entire pattern. To instead have them stop at the first possible character, follow them with a question mark. For example, the pattern <.+> (which lacks a question mark) means: "search for a <, followed by one or more of any character, followed by a >". To stop this pattern from matching the entire string <em>text</em>, append a question mark to the plus sign: <.+?>. This causes the match to stop at the first '>' and thus it matches only the first tag <em>.*MLF**MLF*Look-ahead and look-behind assertions: The groups (?=...), (?!...), (?<=...), and (?<!...) are called assertions because they demand a condition to be met but don't consume any characters. For example, abc(?=.*xyz) is a look-ahead assertion that requires the string xyz to exist somewhere to the right of the string abc (if it doesn't, the entire pattern is not considered a match). (?=...) is called a positive look-ahead because it requires that the specified pattern exist. Conversely, (?!...) is a negative look-ahead because it requires that the specified pattern not exist. Similarly, (?<=...) and (?<!...) are positive and negative look-behinds (respectively) because they look to the left of the current position rather than the right. Look-behinds are more limited than look-aheads because they do not support quantifiers of varying size such as *, ?, and +. The escape sequence \K is similar to a look-behind assertion because it causes any previously-matched characters to be omitted from the final matched string. For example, foo\Kbar matches "foobar" but reports that it has matched "bar".*MLF**MLF*Related: Regular expressions are supported by RegExMatch(), RegExReplace(), and SetTitleMatchMode.*MLF**MLF*Final note: Although this page touches upon most of the commonly-used RegEx features, there are quite a few other features you may want to explore such as conditional subpatterns.

Not only is the broad field of philosophy today far too vast to be embraced by one mind, something similar is true even of many highly specialized subfields."[93]*MLF*In the English-speaking world, analytic philosophy became the dominant school for much of the 20th century. In the first half of the century, it was a cohesive school, shaped strongly by logical positivism, united by the notion that philosophical problems could and should be solved by attention to logic and language. The pioneering work of Bertrand Russell was a model for the early development of analytic philosophy, moving from a rejection of the idealism dominant in late 19th-century British philosophy to an neo-Humean empiricism, strengthened by the conceptual resources of modern mathematical logic.[94][95][96]*MLF*In the latter half of the 20th century, analytic philosophy diffused into a wide variety of disparate philosophical views, only loosely united by historical lines of influence and a self-identified commitment to clarity and rigor. The post-war transformation of the analytic program led in two broad directions: on one hand, an interest in ordinary language as a way of avoiding or redescribing traditional philosophical problems, and on the other, a more thoroughgoing naturalism that sought to dissolve the puzzles of modern philosophy via the results of the natural sciences (such as cognitive psychology and evolutionary biology). The shift in the work of Ludwig Wittgenstein, from a view congruent with logical positivism to a therapeutic dissolution of traditional philosophy as a linguistic misunderstanding of normal forms of life, was the most influential version of the first direction in analytic philosophy.[97][98] The later work of Russell and the philosophy of Willard Van Orman Quine are influential exemplars of the naturalist approach dominant in the second half of the 20th century.[99][100][101][102] But the diversity of analytic philosophy from the 1970s onward defies easy generalization: the naturalism of Quine and his epigoni was in some precincts superseded by a "new metaphysics" of possible worlds, as in the influential work of David Lewis.[103][104] Recently, the experimental philosophy movement has sought to reappraise philosophical problems through social science research techniques.*MLF*On continental Europe, no single school or temperament enjoyed dominance. The flight of the logical positivists from central Europe during the 1930s and 1940s, however, diminished philosophical interest in natural science, and an emphasis on the humanities, broadly construed, figures prominently in what is usually called "continental philosophy". 20th-century movements such as phenomenology, existentialism, modern hermeneutics, critical theory, structuralism, and poststructuralism are included within this loose category. The founder of phenomenology, Edmund Husserl, sought to study consciousness as experienced from a first-person perspective,[105][106] while Martin Heidegger drew on the ideas of Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and Husserl to propose an unconventional existential approach to ontology.[107][108]*MLF*In the Arabic-speaking world, Arab nationalist philosophy became the dominant school of thought, involving philosophers such as Michel Aflaq, Zaki al-Arsuzi, Salah al-Din al-Bitar of Ba'athism and Sati' al-Husri.*MLF*Major traditions*MLF*German idealism*MLF*Main article: German idealism*MLF**MLF*Immanuel Kant*MLF*Forms of idealism were prevalent in philosophy from the 18th century to the early 20th century. 2/5/301 Transcendental idealism, advocated by Immanuel Kant, is the view that there are limits on what can be understood, since there is much that cannot be brought under the conditions of objective judgment. Kant wrote his Critique of Pure Reason (1781–1787) in an attempt to reconcile the conflicting approaches of rationalism and empiricism, and to establish a new groundwork for studying metaphysics. Kant's intention with this work was to look at what we know and then consider what must be true about it, as a logical consequence of the way we know it. One major theme was that there are fundamental features of reality that escape our direct knowledge because of the natural limits of the human faculties.[109] Although Kant held that objective knowledge of the world required the mind to impose a conceptual or categorical framework on the stream of pure sensory data—a framework including space and time themselves—he maintained that things-in-themselves existed independently of our perceptions and judgments; he was therefore not an idealist in any simple sense. Kant's account of things-in-themselves is both controversial and highly complex. Continuing his work, Johann Gottlieb Fichte and Friedrich Schelling dispensed with belief in the independent existence of the world, and created a thoroughgoing idealist philosophy.*MLF*The most notable work of this German idealism was G. W. F. Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit, of 1807. Hegel admitted his ideas were not new, but that all the previous philosophies had been incomplete. His goal was to correctly finish their job. Hegel asserts that the twin aims of philosophy are to account for the contradictions apparent in human experience (which arise, for instance, out of the supposed contradictions between "being" and "not being"), and also simultaneously to resolve and preserve these contradictions by showing their compatibility at a higher level of examination ("being" and "not being" are resolved with "becoming"). This program of acceptance and reconciliation of contradictions is known as the "Hegelian dialectic". Philosophers influenced by Hegel include Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach, who coined the term projection as pertaining to our inability to recognize anything in the external world without projecting qualities of ourselves upon those things; Karl Marx; Friedrich Engels; and the British idealists, notably T. H. Green, J. M. E. McTaggart and F. H. Bradley.*MLF*Few 20th-century philosophers have embraced idealism. However, quite a few have embraced Hegelian dialectic. Immanuel Kant's "Copernican Turn" also remains an important philosophical concept today.*MLF*Pragmatism*MLF*Main articles: Pragmatism and Instrumentalism*MLF**MLF*William James*MLF*Pragmatism was founded in the spirit of finding a scientific concept of truth that does not depend on personal insight (revelation) or reference to some metaphysical realm. The meaning or purport of a statement should be judged by the effect its acceptance would have on practice. Truth is that opinion which inquiry taken far enough would ultimately reach.[110] For Charles Sanders Peirce these were principles of the inquirer's self-regulation, implied by the idea and hope that inquiry is not generally fruitless. The details of how these principles should be interpreted have been subject to discussion since Peirce first conceived them. Peirce's maxim of pragmatism is as follows: "Consider what effects, which might conceivably have practical bearings, we conceive the object of our conception to have. Then, our conception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the object."[111] Like postmodern neo-pragmatist Richard Rorty, many are convinced that pragmatism asserts that the truth of beliefs does not consist in their correspondence with reality, but in their usefulness and efficacy.[112]*MLF*The late 19th-century American philosophers Charles Sanders Peirce and William James were its co-founders, and it was later developed by John Dewey as instrumentalism. Since the usefulness of any belief at any time might be contingent on circumstance, Peirce and James conceptualised final truth as something only established by the future, final settlement of all opinion.[113] Critics have accused pragmatism falling victim to a simple fallacy: because something that is true proves useful, that usefulness is the basis for its truth.[114] Thinkers in the pragmatist tradition have included John Dewey, George Santayana, Quine and C. I. Lewis. Pragmatism has more recently been taken in new directions by Richard Rorty, John Lachs, Donald Davidson, Susan Haack, and Hilary Putnam.*MLF*Phenomenology*MLF*Main article: Phenomenology (philosophy)*MLF**MLF*Edmund Husserl*MLF*Edmund Husserl's phenomenology was an ambitious attempt to lay the foundations for an account of the structure of conscious experience in general.[115] An important part of Husserl's phenomenological project was to show that all conscious acts are directed at or about objective content, a feature that Husserl called intentionality.[116]*MLF*In the first part of his two-volume work, the Logical Investigations (1901), he launched an extended attack on psychologism. In the second part, he began to develop the technique of descriptive phenomenology, with the aim of showing how objective judgments are grounded in conscious experience—not, however, in the first-person experience of particular individuals, but in the properties essential to any experiences of the kind in question.[115]*MLF*He also attempted to identify the essential properties of any act of meaning. He developed the method further in Ideas (1913) as transcendental phenomenology, proposing to ground actual experience, and thus all fields of human knowledge, in the structure of consciousness of an ideal, or transcendental, ego. Later, he attempted to reconcile his transcendental standpoint with an acknowledgement of the intersubjective life-world in which real individual subjects interact. Husserl published only a few works in his lifetime, which treat phenomenology mainly in abstract methodological terms; but he left an enormous quantity of unpublished concrete analyses.*MLF*Husserl's work was immediately influential in Germany, with the foundation of phenomenological schools in Munich and Göttingen. Phenomenology later achieved international fame through the work of such philosophers as Martin Heidegger (formerly Husserl's research assistant), Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Jean-Paul Sartre. Through the work of Heidegger and Sartre, Husserl's focus on subjective experience influenced aspects of existentialism.*MLF*Existentialism*MLF*Main article: Existentialism*MLF*Existentialism is a term applied to the work of a number of late 19th- and 20th-century philosophers who, despite profound doctrinal differences,[117][118] shared the belief that philosophical thinking begins with the human subject—not merely the thinking subject, but the acting, feeling, living human individual.[119] In existentialism, the individual's starting point is characterized by what has been called "the existential attitude", or a sense of disorientation and confusion in the face of an apparently meaningless or absurd world.[120] Many existentialists have also regarded traditional systematic or academic philosophy, in both style and content, as too abstract and remote from concrete human experience.[121][122]*MLF**MLF*Søren Kierkegaard*MLF*Although they did not use the term, the 19th-century philosophers Søren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche are widely regarded as the fathers of existentialism. Their influence, however, has extended beyond existentialist thought.[123][124][125]*MLF*The main target of Kierkegaard's writings was the idealist philosophical system of Hegel which, he thought, ignored or excluded the inner subjective life of living human beings. Kierkegaard, conversely, held that "truth is subjectivity", arguing that what is most important to an actual human being are questions dealing with an individual's inner relationship to existence. In particular, Kierkegaard, a Christian, believed that the truth of religious faith was a subjective question, and one to be wrestled with passionately.[126][127]*MLF*Although Kierkegaard and Nietzsche were among his influences, the extent to which the German philosopher Martin Heidegger should be considered an existentialist is debatable. In Being and Time he presented a method of rooting philosophical explanations in human existence (Dasein) to be analysed in terms of existential categories (existentiale); and this has led many commentators to treat him as an important figure in the existentialist movement. However, in The Letter on Humanism, Heidegger explicitly rejected the existentialism of Jean-Paul Sartre.*MLF*Sartre became the best-known proponent of existentialism, exploring it not only in theoretical works such as Being and Nothingness, but also in plays and novels. Sartre, along with Simone de Beauvoir, represented an avowedly atheistic branch of existentialism, which is now more closely associated with their ideas of nausea, contingency, bad faith, and the absurd than with Kierkegaard's spiritual angst. Nevertheless, the focus on the individual human being, responsible before the universe for the authenticity of his or her existence, is common to all these thinkers.*MLF*Structuralism and post-structuralism*MLF*Main articles: Structuralism and Post-structuralism*MLF*2/1/2001*MLF*Ferdinand de Saussure*MLF*Inaugurated by the linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, structuralism sought to clarify systems of signs through analyzing the discourses they both limit and make possible. Saussure conceived of the sign as being delimited by all the other signs in the system, and ideas as being incapable of existence prior to linguistic structure, which articulates thought. This led continental thought away from humanism, and toward what was termed the decentering of man: language is no longer spoken by man to express a true inner self, but language speaks man.*MLF*Structuralism sought the province of a hard science, but its positivism soon came under fire by poststructuralism, a wide field of thinkers, some of whom were once themselves structuralists, but later came to criticize it. Structuralists believed they could analyze systems from an external, objective standing, for example, but the poststructuralists argued that this is incorrect, that one cannot transcend structures and thus analysis is itself determined by what it examines, while the distinction between the signifier and signified was treated as crystalline by structuralists, poststructuralists asserted that every attempt to grasp the signified results in more signifiers, so meaning is always in a state of being deferred, making an ultimate interpretation impossible.*MLF*Structuralism came to dominate continental philosophy throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, encompassing thinkers as diverse as Claude Lévi-Strauss, Roland Barthes and Jacques Lacan. Post-structuralism came to predominate over the 1970s onwards, including thinkers such as Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, Gilles Deleuze and even Roland Barthes; it incorporated a critique of structuralism's limitations.*MLF*Thomism*MLF**MLF*This article possibly contains original research.

(May 2015)*MLF*Main article: Thomism*MLF**MLF*Alasdair MacIntyre*MLF*Largely Aristotelian in its approach and content, Thomism is a philosophical tradition that follows the writings of Thomas Aquinas. His work has been read, studied, and disputed since the 13th century, especially by Roman Catholics. However, Aquinas has enjoyed a revived interest since the late 19th century, among both atheists (like Philippa Foot) and theists (like Elizabeth Anscombe).[128]*MLF*Thomist philosophers tend to be rationalists in epistemology, as well as metaphysical realists, and virtue ethicists. Human beings are rational animals whose good can be known by reason and pursued by the will. With regard to the soul, Thomists (like Aristotle) argue that soul or psyche is real and immaterial but inseparable from matter in organisms. Soul is the form of the body. Thomists accept all four of Aristotle's causes as natural, including teleological or final causes. In this way, though Aquinas argued that whatever is in the intellect begins in the senses, natural teleology can be discerned with the senses and abstracted from nature through induction.[129]*MLF*Contemporary Thomism contains a diversity of philosophical styles, from Neo-Scholasticism to Existential Thomism.[130] The so-called new natural lawyers like Germain Grisez and Robert P. George have applied Thomistic legal principles to contemporary ethical debates, while cognitive neuroscientist Walter Freeman proposes that Thomism is the philosophical system explaining cognition that is most compatible with neurodynamics, in a 2008 article in the journal Mind and Matter entitled "Nonlinear Brain Dynamics and Intention According to Aquinas." So-called Analytical Thomism of John Haldane and others encourages dialogue between analytic philosophy and broadly Aristotelian philosophy of mind, psychology, and hylomorphic metaphysics.[131] Other modern or contemporary Thomists include Eleonore Stump, Alasdair MacIntyre, and John Finnis.*MLF*The analytic tradition*MLF*Main article: Analytic philosophy*MLF**MLF*Gottlob Frege*MLF*The term analytic philosophy roughly designates a group of philosophical methods that stress detailed argumentation, attention to semantics, use of classical logic and non-classical logics and clarity of meaning above all other criteria. Some have held that philosophical problems arise through misuse of language or because of misunderstandings of the logic of our language, while some maintain that there are genuine philosophical problems and that philosophy is continuous with science. Michael Dummett in his Origins of Analytical Philosophy makes the case for counting Gottlob Frege's The Foundations of Arithmetic as the first analytic work, on the grounds that in that book Frege took the linguistic turn, analyzing philosophical problems through language. Bertrand Russell and G.E. Moore are also often counted as founders of analytic philosophy, beginning with their rejection of British idealism, their defense of realism and the emphasis they laid on the legitimacy of analysis.*MLF*Russell's classic works The Principles of Mathematics,[132] On Denoting and Principia Mathematica with Alfred North Whitehead, aside from greatly promoting the use of mathematical logic in philosophy, set the ground for much of the research program in the early stages of the analytic tradition, emphasizing such problems as: the reference of proper names, whether 'existence' is a property, the nature of propositions, the analysis of definite descriptions, the discussions on the foundations of mathematics; as well as exploring issues of ontological commitment and even metaphysical problems regarding time, the nature of matter, mind, persistence and change, which Russell tackled often with the aid of mathematical logic. Russell and Moore's philosophy, in the beginning of the 20th century, developed as a critique of Hegel and his British followers in particular, and of grand systems of speculative philosophy in general, though by no means all analytic philosophers reject the philosophy of Hegel (see Charles Taylor) nor speculative philosophy. Some schools in the group include logical positivism, and ordinary language both markedly influenced by Russell and Wittgenstein's development of Logical Atomism the former positively and the latter negatively.*MLF*In 1921, Ludwig Wittgenstein, who studied under Russell at Cambridge, published his Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, which gave a rigidly "logical" account of linguistic and philosophical issues. At the time, he understood most of the problems of philosophy as mere puzzles of language, which could be solved by investigating and then minding the logical structure of language. Years later, he reversed a number of the positions he set out in the Tractatus, in for example his second major work, Philosophical Investigations (1953). Investigations was influential in the development of "ordinary language philosophy," which was promoted by Gilbert Ryle, J.L. Austin, and a few others.*MLF*In the United States, meanwhile, the philosophy of Quine was having a major influence, with the paper Two Dogmas of Empiricism. In that paper Quine criticizes the distinction between analytic and synthetic statements, arguing that a clear conception of analyticity is unattainable. He argued for holism, the thesis that language, including scientific language, is a set of interconnected sentences, none of which can be verified on its own, rather, the sentences in the language depend on each other for their meaning and truth conditions. A consequence of Quine's approach is that language as a whole has only a thin relation to experience. Some sentences that refer directly to experience might be modified by sense impressions, but as the whole of language is theory-laden, for the whole language to be modified, more than this is required. However, most of the linguistic structure can in principle be revised, even logic, in order to better model the world.*MLF**MLF*Patricia Churchland*MLF*Notable students of Quine include Donald Davidson and Daniel Dennett. The former devised a program for giving a semantics to natural language and thereby answer the philosophical conundrum "what is meaning?". A crucial part of the program was the use of Alfred Tarski's semantic theory of truth. Dummett, among others, argued that truth conditions should be dispensed with in the theory of meaning, and replaced by assertability conditions. Some propositions, on this view, are neither true nor false, and thus such a theory of meaning entails a rejection of the law of the excluded middle. This, for Dummett, entails antirealism, as Russell himself pointed out in his An Inquiry into Meaning and Truth.*MLF*By the 1970s there was a renewed interest in many traditional philosophical problems by the younger generations of analytic philosophers. David Lewis, Saul Kripke, Derek Parfit and others took an interest in traditional metaphysical problems, which they began exploring by the use of logic and philosophy of language. Among those problems some distinguished ones were: free will, essentialism, the nature of personal identity, identity over time, the nature of the mind, the nature of causal laws, space-time, the properties of material beings, modality, etc. In those universities where analytic philosophy has spread, these problems are still being discussed passionately. Analytic philosophers are also interested in the methodology of analytic philosophy itself, with Timothy Williamson, Wykeham Professor of Logic at Oxford, publishing recently a book entitled The Philosophy of Philosophy. Some influential figures in contemporary analytic philosophy are: Timothy Williamson, David Lewis, John Searle, Thomas Nagel, Hilary Putnam, Michael Dummett, Peter van Inwagen, Saul Kripke and Patricia Churchland. Analytic philosophy has sometimes been accused of not contributing to the political debate or to traditional questions in aesthetics. However, with the appearance of A Theory of Justice by John Rawls and Anarchy, State and Utopia by Robert Nozick, analytic political philosophy acquired respectability. Analytic philosophers have also shown depth in their investigations of aesthetics, with Roger Scruton, Nelson Goodman, Arthur Danto and others developing the subject to its current shape.*MLF*Applied philosophy*MLF**MLF*Martin Luther King Jr*MLF*The ideas conceived by a society have profound repercussions on what actions the society performs. As Richard Weaver has argued, "ideas have consequences". The study of philosophy yields applications such as those in ethics—applied ethics in particular—and political philosophy. The political and economic philosophies of Confucius, Sun Zi, Chanakya, Ibn Khaldun, Ibn Rushd, Ibn Taimiyyah, Niccolò Machiavelli, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Adam Smith, Karl Marx, John Stuart Mill, Leo Tolstoy, Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., and others—all of these have been used to shape and justify governments and their actions.*MLF*In the field of philosophy of education, progressive education as championed by John Dewey has had a profound impact on educational practices in the United States in the 20th century. Descendants of this movement include the current efforts in philosophy for children, which are part of philosophy education. Carl von Clausewitz's political philosophy of war has had a profound effect on statecraft, international politics, and military strategy in the 20th century, especially in the years around World War II. Logic has become crucially important in mathematics, linguistics, psychology, computer science, and computer engineering.*MLF*Other important applications can be found in epistemology, which aid in understanding the requisites for knowledge, sound evidence, and justified belief (important in law, economics, decision theory, and a number of other disciplines). The philosophy of science discusses the underpinnings of the scientific method and has affected the nature of scientific investigation and argumentation. As such, philosophy has fundamental implications for science as a whole. For example, the strictly empirical approach of Skinner's behaviorism affected for decades the approach of the American psychological establishment. Deep ecology and animal rights examine the moral situation of humans as occupants of a world that has non-human occupants to consider also. Aesthetics can help to interpret discussions of music, literature, the plastic arts, and the whole artistic dimension of life. In general, the various philosophies strive to provide practical activities with a deeper understanding of the theoretical or conceptual underpinnings of their fields.*MLF*Often philosophy is seen as an investigation into an area not sufficiently well understood to be its own branch of knowledge. For example, what were once philosophical pursuits have evolved into the modern day fields such as psychology, sociology, linguistics, and economics.*MLF*See also*MLF*Main article: Outline of philosophy*MLF*Portal icon	Philosophy portal*MLF*Book icon	*MLF*Book: Philosophy*MLF*List of important publications in philosophy*MLF*List of years in philosophy*MLF*List of philosophy journals*MLF*List of unsolved problems in philosophy*MLF*Lists of philosophers*MLF*Social theory*MLF*References*MLF*^ Jenny Teichmann and Katherine C.

Philosophy is rationally critical thinking, of a more or less systematic kind about the general nature of the world (metaphysics or theory of existence), the justification of belief (epistemology or theory of knowledge), and the conduct of life (ethics or theory of value). Each of the three elements in this list has a non-philosophical counterpart, from which it is distinguished by its explicitly rational and critical way of proceeding and by its systematic nature. Everyone has some general conception of the nature of the world in which they live and of their place in it. Metaphysics replaces the unargued assumptions embodied in such a conception with a rational and organized body of beliefs about the world as a whole. Everyone has occasion to doubt and question beliefs, their own or those of others, with more or less success and without any theory of what they are doing. Epistemology seeks by argument to make explicit the rules of correct belief formation. Everyone governs their conduct by directing it to desired or valued ends. Ethics, or moral philosophy, in its most inclusive sense, seeks to articulate, in rationally systematic form, the rules or principles involved.*MLF*^ "Online Etymology Dictionary". etymonline.com.*MLF*^ "Philosophy".

Anthony Kenny's New History of Western Philosophy is divided in four volumes: ancient, medieval, early modern (1500–1830), and later modern (1830 to the present). The more technical Cambridge History of Philosophy divides the topic into nine periods: Greek philosophy to Aristotle, Hellenistic philosophy, later Greek and early medieval, later medieval, Renaissance, three volumes for the 17th–19th centuries, and a final volume on 1870–1945.*MLF*^ M.

This essay examines one such course, the History of Modern Philosophy, and the texts that helped to create it.

For example, the regular expression abc matches abc123, 123abc, and 123abcxyz. To require the match to occur only at the beginning or end, use an anchor.*MLF**MLF*Escaped characters: Most characters like abc123 can be used literally inside a regular expression. However, the characters \.*?+[{|()^$ must be preceded by a backslash to be seen as literal. For example, \. is a literal period and \\ is a literal backslash. Escaping can be avoided by using \Q...\E. For example: \QLiteral Text\E.*MLF**MLF*Case-sensitive: By default, regular expressions are case-sensitive. This can be changed via the "i" option. For example, the pattern i)abc searches for "abc" without regard to case. See below for other modifiers.*MLF**MLF*Options (case sensitive)*MLF* *MLF*At the very beginning of a regular expression, specify zero or more of the following options followed by a close-parenthesis. For example, the pattern "im)abc" would search for abc with the case-insensitive and multiline options (the parenthesis may be omitted when there are no options). Although this syntax breaks from tradition, it requires no special delimiters (such as forward-slash), and thus there is no need to escape such delimiters inside the pattern. In addition, performance is improved because the options are easier to parse.*MLF**MLF*iCase-insensitive matching, which treats the letters A through Z as identical to their lowercase counterparts.*MLF*m*MLF*Multiline. Views Haystack as a collection of individual lines (if it contains newlines) rather than as a single continuous line. Specifically, it changes the following:*MLF**MLF*1) Circumflex (^) matches immediately after all internal newlines -- as well as at the start of Haystack where it always matches (but it does not match after a newline at the very end of Haystack).*MLF**MLF*2) Dollar-sign ($) matches before any newlines in Haystack (as well as at the very end where it always matches).*MLF**MLF*For example, the pattern "m)^abc$" would not match the Haystack"xyz`r`nabc" unless the "m" option is present.*MLF**MLF*The "D" option is ignored when "m" is present.*MLF**MLF*sDotAll. This causes a period (.) to match all characters including newlines (normally, it does not match newlines). However, when the newline character is at its default of CRLF (`r`n), two dots are required to match it (not one). Regardless of this option, a negative class such as [^a] always matches newlines.*MLF*xIgnores whitespace characters in the pattern except when escaped or inside a character class. The characters `n and `t are among those ignored because by the time they get to PCRE, they are already raw/literal whitespace characters (by contrast, \n and \t are not ignored because they are PCRE escape sequences). The x option also ignores characters between a non-escaped # outside a character class and the next newline character, inclusive. This makes it possible to include comments inside complicated patterns. However, this applies only to data characters; whitespace may never appear within special character sequences such as (?(, which begins a conditional subpattern.*MLF*AForces the pattern to be anchored; that is, it can match only at the start of Haystack. Under most conditions, this is equivalent to explicitly anchoring the pattern by means such as "^".*MLF*DForces dollar-sign ($) to match at the very end of Haystack, even if Haystack's last item is a newline. Without this option, $ instead matches right before the final newline (if there is one). Note: This option is ignored when the "m" option is present.*MLF*JAllows duplicate named subpatterns. This can be useful for patterns in which only one of a collection of identically-named subpatterns can match. Note: If more than one instance of a particular name matches something, only the leftmost one is stored. Also, variable names are not case-sensitive.*MLF*UUngreedy. Makes the quantifiers *+?{} consume only those characters absolutely necessary to form a match, leaving the remaining ones available for the next part of the pattern. When the "U" option is not in effect, an individual quantifier can be made non-greedy by following it with a question mark. Conversely, when "U" is in effect, the question mark makes an individual quantifier greedy.*MLF*XPCRE_EXTRA. Enables PCRE features that are incompatible with Perl. Currently, the only such feature is that any backslash in a pattern that is followed by a letter that has no special meaning causes the match to fail and ErrorLevel to be set accordingly. This option helps reserve unused backslash sequences for future use. Without this option, a backslash followed by a letter with no special meaning is treated as a literal (e.g. \g and g are both recognized as a literal g). Regardless of this option, non-alphabetic backslash sequences that have no special meaning are always treated as literals (e.g. \/ and / are both recognized as forward-slash).*MLF*PPosition mode. This causes RegExMatch() to yield the position and length of the match and its subpatterns rather than their matching substrings. For details, see UnquotedOutputVar.*MLF*SStudies the pattern to try improve its performance. This is useful when a particular pattern (especially a complex one) will be executed many times. If PCRE finds a way to improve performance, that discovery is stored alongside the pattern in the cache for use by subsequent executions of the same pattern (subsequent uses of that pattern should also specify the S option because finding a match in the cache requires that the option letters exactly match, including their order).*MLF*CEnables the auto-callout mode. See Regular Expression Callouts for more info.*MLF*`nSwitches from the default newline character (`r`n) to a solitary linefeed (`n), which is the standard on UNIX systems. The chosen newline character affects the behavior of anchors (^ and $) and the dot/period pattern.*MLF*`rSwitches from the default newline character (`r`n) to a solitary carriage return (`r).*MLF*`aIn v1.0.46.06+, `a recognizes any type of newline, namely `r, `n, `r`n, `v/VT/vertical tab/chr(0xB), `f/FF/formfeed/chr(0xC), and NEL/next-line/chr(0x85). In v1.0.47.05+, newlines can be restricted to only CR, LF, and CRLF by instead specifying (*ANYCRLF) in uppercase at the beginning of the pattern (after the options); e.g. im)(*ANYCRLF)^abc$.*MLF**MLF*Note: Spaces and tabs may optionally be used to separate each option from the next.*MLF**MLF*Commonly Used Symbols and Syntax*MLF* *MLF*.By default, a dot matches any single character which is not part of a newline (`r`n) sequence, but this can be changed by using the DotAll (s), linefeed (`n), carriage return (`r), `a or (*ANYCRLF) options. For example, ab. matches abc and abz and ab_.*MLF***MLF*An asterisk matches zero or more of the preceding character, class, or subpattern. For example, a* matches ab and aaab. It also matches at the very beginning of any string that contains no "a" at all.*MLF**MLF*Wildcard: The dot-star pattern .* is one of the most permissive because it matches zero or more occurrences of any character (except newline: `r and `n). For example, abc.*123 matches abcAnything123 as well as abc123.*MLF**MLF*?A question mark matches zero or one of the preceding character, class, or subpattern. Think of this as "the preceding item is optional". For example, colou?r matches both color and colour because the "u" is optional.*MLF*+A plus sign matches one or more of the preceding character, class, or subpattern. For example a+ matches ab and aaab. But unlike a* and a?, the pattern a+ does not match at the beginning of strings that lack an "a" character.*MLF*{min,max}*MLF*Matches between min and max occurrences of the preceding character, class, or subpattern. For example, a{1,2} matches ab but only the first two a's in aaab.*MLF**MLF*Also, {3} means exactly 3 occurrences, and {3,} means 3 or more occurrences. Note: The specified numbers must be less than 65536, and the first must be less than or equal to the second.*MLF**MLF*[...]*MLF*Classes of characters: The square brackets enclose a list or range of characters (or both). For example, [abc] means "any single character that is either a, b or c". Using a dash in between creates a range; for example, [a-z] means "any single character that is between lowercase a and z (inclusive)". Lists and ranges may be combined; for example [a-zA-Z0-9_] means "any single character that is alphanumeric or underscore".*MLF**MLF*A character class may be followed by *, ?, +, or {min,max}. For example, [0-9]+ matches one or more occurrence of any digit; thus it matches xyz123 but not abcxyz.*MLF**MLF*The following POSIX named sets are also supported via the form [[:xxx:]], where xxx is one of the following words: alnum, alpha, ascii (0-127), blank (space or tab), cntrl (control character), digit (0-9), xdigit (hex digit), print, graph (print excluding space), punct, lower, upper, space (whitespace), word (same as \w).*MLF**MLF*Within a character class, characters do not need to be escaped except when they have special meaning inside a class; e.g. [\^a], [a\-b], [a\]], and [\\a].*MLF**MLF*[^...]Matches any single character that is not in the class. For example, [^/]* matches zero or more occurrences of any character that is not a forward-slash, such as http://. Similarly, [^0-9xyz] matches any single character that isn't a digit and isn't the letter x, y, or z.*MLF*\dMatches any single digit (equivalent to the class [0-9]). Conversely, capital \D means "any non-digit". This and the other two below can also be used inside a class; for example, [\d.-] means "any single digit, period, or minus sign".*MLF*\sMatches any single whitespace character, mainly space, tab, and newline (`r and `n). Conversely, capital \S means "any non-whitespace character".*MLF*\wMatches any single "word" character, namely alphanumeric or underscore. This is equivalent to [a-zA-Z0-9_]. Conversely, capital \W means "any non-word character".*MLF*^*MLF* $*MLF*Circumflex (^) and dollar sign ($) are called anchors because they don't consume any characters; instead, they tie the pattern to the beginning or end of the string being searched.*MLF**MLF*^ may appear at the beginning of a pattern to require the match to occur at the very beginning of a line. For example, ^abc matches abc123 but not 123abc.*MLF**MLF*$ may appear at the end of a pattern to require the match to occur at the very end of a line. For example, abc$ matches 123abc but not abc123.*MLF**MLF*The two anchors may be combined. For example, ^abc$ matches only abc (i.e. there must be no other characters before or after it).*MLF**MLF*If the text being searched contains multiple lines, the anchors can be made to apply to each line rather than the text as a whole by means of the "m" option. For example, m)^abc$ matches 123`r`nabc`r`n789. But without the "m" option, it wouldn't match.*MLF**MLF*\b\b means "word boundary", which is like an anchor because it doesn't consume any characters. It requires the current character's status as a word character (\w) to be the opposite of the previous character's. It is typically used to avoid accidentally matching a word that appears inside some other word. For example, \bcat\b doesn't match catfish, but it matches cat regardless of what punctuation and whitespace surrounds it. Capital \B is the opposite: it requires that the current character not be at a word boundary.*MLF*|The vertical bar separates two or more alternatives. A match occurs if any of the alternatives is satisfied. For example, gray|grey matches both gray and grey. Similarly, the pattern gr(a|e)y does the same thing with the help of the parentheses described below.*MLF*(...)*MLF*Items enclosed in parentheses are most commonly used to:*MLF*Determine the order of evaluation. For example, (Sun|Mon|Tues|Wednes|Thurs|Fri|Satur)day matches the name of any day.*MLF*Apply *, ?, +, or {min,max} to a series of characters rather than just one. For example, (abc)+ matches one or more occurrences of the string "abc"; thus it matches abcabc123 but not ab123 or bc123.*MLF*Capture a subpattern such as the dot-star in abc(.*)xyz. For example, RegExMatch() stores the substring that matches each subpattern in its output array. Similarly, RegExReplace() allows the substring that matches each subpattern to be reinserted into the result via backreferences like $1. To use the parentheses without the side-effect of capturing a subpattern, specify ?: as the first two characters inside the parentheses; for example: (?:.*)*MLF*Change options on-the-fly. For example, (?im) turns on the case-insensitive and multiline options for the remainder of the pattern (or subpattern if it occurs inside a subpattern). Conversely, (?-im) would turn them both off. All options are supported except DPS`r`n`a.*MLF**MLF*\t*MLF* \r*MLF* etc.*MLF*These escape sequences stand for special characters. The most common ones are \t (tab), \r (carriage return), and \n (linefeed). In AutoHotkey, an accent (`) may optionally be used in place of the backslash in these cases. Escape sequences in the form \xhh are also supported, in which hh is the hex code of any ANSI character between 00 and FF.*MLF**MLF*In v1.0.46.06+, \R means "any single newline of any type", namely those listed at the `a option (however, \R inside a character class is merely the letter "R"). In v1.0.47.05+, \R can be restricted to CR, LF, and CRLF by specifying (*BSR_ANYCRLF) in uppercase at the beginning of the pattern (after the options); e.g. im)(*BSR_ANYCRLF)abc\Rxyz*MLF**MLF*\p{xx}*MLF*\P{xx}*MLF*\X*MLF*[v1.0.90+]: Unicode character properties. Not supported on ANSI builds. \p{xx} matches a character with the xx property while \P{xx} matches any character without the xx property. For example, \pL matches any letter and \p{Lu} matches any upper-case letter. \X matches any number of characters that form an extended Unicode sequence.*MLF**MLF*For a full list of supported property names and other details, search for "\p{xx}" at www.pcre.org/pcre.txt.*MLF**MLF*(*UCP)*MLF*[v1.0.90+]: For performance, \d, \D, \s, \S, \w, \W, \b and \B recognize only ASCII characters by default, even on Unicode builds. If the pattern begins with (*UCP), Unicode properties will be used to determine which characters match. For example, \w becomes equivalent to [\p{L}\p{N}_] and \d becomes equivalent to \p{Nd}.*MLF**MLF**MLF*Greed: By default, *, ?, +, and {min,max} are greedy because they consume all characters up through the last possible one that still satisfies the entire pattern. To instead have them stop at the first possible character, follow them with a question mark. For example, the pattern <.+> (which lacks a question mark) means: "search for a <, followed by one or more of any character, followed by a >". To stop this pattern from matching the entire string <em>text</em>, append a question mark to the plus sign: <.+?>. This causes the match to stop at the first '>' and thus it matches only the first tag <em>.*MLF**MLF*Look-ahead and look-behind assertions: The groups (?=...), (?!...), (?<=...), and (?<!...) are called assertions because they demand a condition to be met but don't consume any characters. For example, abc(?=.*xyz) is a look-ahead assertion that requires the string xyz to exist somewhere to the right of the string abc (if it doesn't, the entire pattern is not considered a match). (?=...) is called a positive look-ahead because it requires that the specified pattern exist. Conversely, (?!...) is a negative look-ahead because it requires that the specified pattern not exist. Similarly, (?<=...) and (?<!...) are positive and negative look-behinds (respectively) because they look to the left of the current position rather than the right. Look-behinds are more limited than look-aheads because they do not support quantifiers of varying size such as *, ?, and +. The escape sequence \K is similar to a look-behind assertion because it causes any previously-matched characters to be omitted from the final matched string. For example, foo\Kbar matches "foobar" but reports that it has matched "bar".RegNeedle=[A-Z][A-Z]
